# Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis and Regression Models for Predicting Tesla Share Prices and Sentiment

The accurate prediction of stock prices has always posed a significant challenge for investors and financial analysts due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. Among the various factors influencing share prices, market sentiment plays a crucial role as it reflects market participants' speculation and expectations. Negative market sentiment is often associated with share price declines and market downturns, while positive sentiment tends to drive share prices higher. Understanding and predicting market sentiment can provide valuable insights for investors in making informed decisions.

In the context of this project, the hypothesis was formulated that there exists a linear relationship between sentiment and share price data. This hypothesis assumes that changes in sentiment levels would directly impact share prices in a linear manner. To investigate this relationship, linear regression was employed to predict share prices based on sentiment scores. Additionally, logistic regression was used to predict sentiment labels based on share price data. By analyzing the relationship between sentiment and share prices, it becomes possible to gain insights into the potential predictive power of sentiment analysis in forecasting share price movements.

To conduct the analysis, Tesla, a prominent growth stock, was chosen as the focus of this study. Unlike value stocks that are primarily influenced by financial fundamentals, growth stocks like Tesla are heavily affected by market speculation. Market participants often have high expectations for the growth potential of such stocks, leading to increased volatility and sensitivity to sentiment fluctuations. Examining Tesla's share price movements in relation to market sentiment can shed light on the impact of speculation and sentiment on the value of growth stocks.

By investigating the linear relationship between sentiment and share price data and employing logistic regression to predict sentiment labels, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the interplay between market sentiment and share prices, particularly in the context of a growth stock like Tesla. The findings from this analysis have the potential to provide valuable insights for investors and financial analysts, aiding in more informed decision-making and potentially improving the accuracy of stock price predictions.
